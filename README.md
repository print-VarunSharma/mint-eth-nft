# BabyNFT project

## HardHat

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

Chose your Network carefully.
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network ropsten to deploy on the test chain
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network main to deploy on the live Eth chain

Note:

- ropsten testnet will be deprecated in Oct of 2022.
