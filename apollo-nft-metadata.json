  "description": "Story: This is little baby Apollo at 3 months old! This was a picture of him right after a fresh bath! | About The Picture:  The image is an AI rendering of the original picture so this is adjacent to AI art. | About Apollo:  Apollo was a special dog from the get-go. He was incredibly intelligent, sweet, and quite the crafty bandit. I remember we had just pee pad trained him at 2.5 months old and he knew that he would get a treat each time he did his business on the pee pad. So despite his young baby age, he would walk to the pee pad, made sure we were looking, and would let our a drop or two, then would come over for a treat, and he knew we had to give him one still for following the routine. What a cheeky guy! :D",
